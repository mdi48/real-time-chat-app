# A real-time chat application written using Django and AJAX

A Django application that utilizes AJAX scripting to create a real-time chat application. Rooms are created for every subject entered in the room field and messages
are associated with each room via database retrieval. AJAX is used to ensure that each room does not need to reload every time a message is posted there. Just a small,
fun little hobby project really. There are still some issues in the styling that I need to fix, but everything works perfectly fine at the moment. Enter "Test" (without
quotation marks) as a Room field and any username you want to see a small example of what it looks like.
